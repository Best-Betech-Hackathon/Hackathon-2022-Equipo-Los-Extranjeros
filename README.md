#Hackathon-2022-Team-The-Extraders Team
Greetings! We are Sergeant Rodrigo and Sergeant Bayron, commanders of the great army known as the Rebellion, we are delighted to have foreigners to bring in some fresh ideas.

**In this repository you will be able to upload your progress.

Milestone 1** is intended for learning and familiarization with the platform so the delivery of your solutions is optional.

For **Milestone 2** the delivery is mandatory.

In milestone 2 it is especially important that you are doing the construction little by little and that we see that you are doing several comits. In this case it is necessary that each comit has a brief information of what has been done in that comit in the description section (to be filled in before making the comit). This way the jury will be able to see the progress and the strategy followed in the development.

Go for it!
